Having finished a Team Treehouse track on React.js I decided to tackle my own project, so I meade a weather app. After completing the Weather App I wanted to keep practicing the skills I learned so I created this Movie app.

The user can pick a year, and the app displays the top 10 movies for that year. Starting at 1 the user can scroll through to 10.

Used much of the same logic as the Weather app

1. create-react-app
2. Added components
3. Async call to The Movie DB
4. Parsed data to JSON
5. Added counter so user can change which movie is displayed
6. Selected movie displayed to user
7. Made the UI using Bootstrap and class

Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- React.js
